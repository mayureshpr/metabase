  # The quoting strategy decides when things like column names should be quoted. This is in place to deal with
  # Liquibase not knowing about all of the new reserved words in MySQL 8+. Using a column name that is a reserved word
  # causes a failure. Quoting all objects breaks H2 support though as it will quote table names but not quote that
  # same table name in a foreign key reference which will cause a failure when trying to initially setup the database.

# >>>>>>>>>> DO NOT ADD NEW MIGRATIONS BELOW THIS LINE! ADD THEM ABOVE <<<<<<<<<<

#
# ADVICE:
#
# 1) Run ./bin/lint-migrations-file.sh to run core.spec checks against any changes you make here. Liquibase is pretty
#    forgiving and won't complain if you accidentally mix up things like deleteCascade and onDelete: CASCADE. CI runs
#    this check but it's nicer to know now instead of waiting for CI.
#
# 2) Please post a message in the Metabase Slack #migrations channel to let others know you are creating a new
#    migration so someone else doesn't steal your ID number
#
# 3) Migrations IDs should follow the format
#
#    vMM.mm-NNN
#
#    where
#
#    M = major version
#    m = minor version
#    N = migration number relative to that major+minor version
#
#   e.g. the first migration added to 0.42.0 should be numbered v42.00-000 and the second migration should be numbered
#   v42.00-001. The first migration for 0.42.1 should be numbered v42.01-000, and so forth.
#
#   This numbering scheme was adopted beginning with version 0.42.0 so that we could go back and add migrations to patch
#   releases without the ID sequence getting wildly out of order. See PR #18821 for more information.
